## Weekly Payroll System using Ruby
There are two files used for the
payroll system: 
- payroll.rb
- helper.rb
  
The system was created using object-oriented features such as classes and methods, different types of variables (global, class, instance, local), and other useful constructs.


## Program Flow
The program starts at the menu where a number of options are available
for the user to choose from. The user can change the default settings for the week
before starting the week itself. After the week has started, the user can choose to
change each dayâ€™s default settings and input the OUT time. Then after the week
has ended, information about the week is displayed, including the total week
salary. To exit the program, the player can press [E] to exit the program anytime,
or [4] to exit at the menu.
