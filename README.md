# CSADPRG-MCO

## Purpose of MCO:
The purpose basically serves to support the theoretical foundations of programming languages
discussed in class, by comparing, and evaluating the features and constructs
of different programming languages. For this iteration of the MCO, all groups are tasked
to study Go, Kotlin, R, and Ruby.

By the end of the project, students should have acquired an understanding of the different paradigms
supported by various languages and appreciate the similarities and differences in their
language features.
